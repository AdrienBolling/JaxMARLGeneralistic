# Contributing to JaxMARL

Please help build JaxMARL into the best possible tool for the MARL community. 

## Contributing code

We actively welcome your contributions!
 - If adding an environment or algorithm, check with us that it is the right fit for the repo.
 - Fork the repo and create your branch from main.
 - Add tests, or show proof that the environment/algorithm works.
 - Add a README explaining your environment/algorithm.

## Bug reports

We use Github's issues to track bugs, just open a new issue! Great Bug Reports tend to have:
 - A quick summary and/or background
 - Steps to reproduce (Be specific and give example code if you can)
 - What you expected would happen
 - What actually happens
 - Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)


## License 

All contributions will fall under the project's original license.

## Roadmap

Some improvements we would like to see implemented:
- [ ] improved RNN implementations. In the current implementation, the hidden size is dependent on "NUM_STEPS", it should be made independent. Speed could also be improved with an S5 architecture.
